## Alumni

### Dr Rosti Readioff
Rosti is a chartered engineer, interested in tissue mechanics and computational modelling of biological systems using both finite element and musculoskeletal modelling. She is currently working on the application of technology to support people with spinal cord injury.

She enjoys all sort of outdoor activities (i.e. walking, hiking and cycling) and anything that might involve spending time in nature. She is a seasonal 5k and 10k runner, and has previously completely a half marathon. Occasionally, she dabbles in photography and playing guitar. In general, she loves plants, birds, cats (although highly allergic to them) and mathematics.

You can find Rosti on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dr_rosti) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-rosti-readioff-ceng-mimeche-843114113/).

### Rachel Reddihough
Rachel is Project Manager for [New Vic Borderlines](http://www.newvictheatre.org.uk/education-and-community/borderlines/). She has a special interesting in lighting design and creating new spaces using light. Rachel has been instrumental in creating the Cultural Animation methodology and creating exhibitions and workshops for many [AHRC](https://ahrc.ukri.org/) projects.

Outside of work she owns two horses and competes in Dressage and Cross Country.

### Alice Faux-Nightingale
Alice is a Biology and Psychology graduate with past experience researching animal behaviour and welfare. More recently she has become interested in human experiences of movement disorders, and is currently looking into creative methods of engaging the public with research.

When not working, Alice enjoys playing the piano, painting, and working with fabric. At the weekends she can often be found out in the garden or spending time with her two cats.
