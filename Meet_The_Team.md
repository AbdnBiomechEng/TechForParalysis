### Dr Rosti Readioff
Rosti is a chartered engineer, interested in tissue mechanics and computational modelling of biological systems using both finite element and musculoskeletal modelling. She is currently working on the application of technology to support people with spinal cord injury. 

She enjoys all sort of outdoor activities (i.e. walking, hiking and cycling) and anything that might involve spending time in nature. She is a seasonal 5k and 10k runner, and has previously completely a half marathon. Occasionally, she dabbles in photography and playing guitar. In general, she loves plants, birds, cats (although highly allergic to them) and mathematics.

You can find Rosti on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dr_rosti) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-rosti-readioff-ceng-mimeche-843114113/).
