We want our project to be an open and welcoming environment! 

To create a positive environment for everyone, please:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Show empathy towards other contributors
* Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

To report an issue, please contact [Dimitra](https://github.com/dblana).
