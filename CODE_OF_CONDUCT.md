We want our project to be an open and welcoming environment! 

We are particularly keen to support first-time contributors and people who are looking to learn and develop their skills.

To create a positive environment for everyone, please:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best for the community
* Show empathy towards other community members
* Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members of the community who violate these rules - no matter how much they have contributed to the project, or how specialised their skill set - will be approached by a member of the leadership team. If inappropriate behaviour persists after a discussion with the leadership team member the contributer will be asked to discontinue their participation in the project.

To report an issue, please contact [Dimitra](https://github.com/dblana).
