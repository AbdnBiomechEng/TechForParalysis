## The python wrapper is coming from: the [Human Computer Integration Lab, Chicago](https://github.com/humancomputerintegration/rehamove-integration-lib)
    # please read the license and limitations

## Notes:
- had to disable USB sleep in power settings on a windows laptop to keep the rehastim working reliably
- one of the usb port is not working reliably, even with the new power settings (need to use the left port on ABD's laptop)
- the pre-compiled python library for windows that is available on github requires python 3.7 (otherwise recompile)
- keep using the low-level mode, to send individual pulses
