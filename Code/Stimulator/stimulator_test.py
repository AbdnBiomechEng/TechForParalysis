The python wrapper is coming from: https://github.com/humancomputerintegration/rehamove-integration-lib
    # please read the license and limitations

Notes:
    - had to disable USB sleep in power settings on a windows laptop
    - one of the usb port is not working reliably (need to use the left port on ABD's laptop)
    - the pre-compiled python library for windows that is available on github requires python 3.7 (otherwise recompile)
    - keep using the low-level mode, to send individual pulses

2do:
    - make anaconda env including serial-tool
    - include test to load the lib. windows/linux
    - add a loop to wait for the hardware to be connected
