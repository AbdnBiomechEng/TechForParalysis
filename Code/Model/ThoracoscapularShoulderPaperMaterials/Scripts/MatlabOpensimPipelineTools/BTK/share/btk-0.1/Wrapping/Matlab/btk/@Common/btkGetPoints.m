function [points pointsInfo] = btkGetPoints(h) %#ok
%BTKGETPOINTS Extract points from a biomechanical acquisition
% 
%  POINTS = BTKGETPOINTS(H) returns a structure of points.  Each 
%  fieldname in POINTS corresponds to a point's label.  The biomechanical 
%  acquisition handle H is represented as a double and can be only
%  used with the btk* functions.
%
%  [POINTS POINTSINFO] = BTKGETPOINTS(H) returns points' informations  
%  in POINTSINFO.  The structure POINTSINFO has the followig fields:
%    - POINTSINFO.FIRSTFRAME
%    - POINTSINFO.FREQUENCY
%    - POINTSINFO.UNITS
%    - POINTSINFO.RESIDUALS
%    - POINTSINFO.MASKS
%  POINTSINFO.FIRSTFRAME contains the index of the first frame of the 
%  acquisition. POINTSINFO.FREQUENCY contains the points' frequency.  
%  POINTSINFO.UNITS contains the unit of each point.  Each fieldname in 
%  POINTSINFO.UNITS corresponds to point's label.  POINTSINFO.RESIDUALS
%  contains the point's residuals.  POINTSINFO.MASKS contains the point's
%  masks as field of strings.
