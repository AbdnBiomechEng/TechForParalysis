## Optimisation of elbow flexion-extension

First, make sure you add the folders **TechForParalysis\Code\Model** and **TechForParalysis\Code\Model\OptimalControl** to the Matlab path.

To choose which muscles to include in the optimisation, run **include_subset_muscles.m**. You might want to run **get_muscle_names.m** first, so you can see which indices correspond to which muscles, and change line 11 in this file accordingly.

You run the optimisation in **runopt_elbow.m**. In this file you can set:

- the starting number of nodes
- maximum number of nodes
- initial guess
- weights for the kinematic and energy consumption terms
- target movement. You can choose a movement or a static posture (for which # nodes = 1).

At the end of each IPOPT run, it prints out something like this:

IPOPT info status: 1

Objfun (unweighted):   0.23037 (fit) +   0.14236 (effort)

Objfun (weighted):  23.17969 =  23.03733 (fit) +   0.14236 (effort)

Norm(ceq):   0.00056

The first line shows the reason for termination: 0 means "solved", 1 means "solved to acceptable level", for the rest see [the Matlab Interface for IPOPT](https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/mavt/dynamic-systems-n-control/idsc-dam/Research_Onder/Downloads/IPOPT/IPOPT_MatlabInterface_V0p1.pdf), section 4.

**Objfun** is the value of the objective function, as a sum of the two terms, first unweighted, and then weighted. In the example above, the weights are 100 for the kinematic fit, and 1 for the effort.

**Norm(ceq)** is the magnitude of the linear equality constraints.

You can run **print_results_obj.m** to make graphs of the output elbow angle and muscle activations.

If you want to call the model (das3.mexw64) to get, for example, muscle moment arms or lengths for additional plots, see [das3.m in the DAS3 repository](https://github.com/dasproject/DAS3/blob/master/model/das3.m).
