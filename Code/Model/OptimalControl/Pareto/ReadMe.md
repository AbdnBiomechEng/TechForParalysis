## Elbow kinematics

To optimise elbow trajectory and muscle activations.

1. First run find_das3elbow_feas_solutions.m to find a range of feasible solutions. This 'runs' an optimisation with the cost function set to zero just to generate a set of feasible solutions for an initial population.
2. Run create_initial_population_elbow.m to select the successful outputs from the previous step and save them in a matrix (mat file init_pop_elbow_pareto). This also plots histograms and a scatterplot of the two cost functions.
3. Run das3elbow_optimize_pareto.m by entering ```result = das3elbow_optimize_pareto('output_filename');``` at the command line
